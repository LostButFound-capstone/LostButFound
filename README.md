# LostButFound Capstone

A Codeup Capstone project created using Java, Springboot, Hibernate, Thymleaf, Jquery, Custom CSS, JavaScript, and FileStack API.

LostButFound is an application used to help users post found property, or search for lost property in the San Antonio Area. A LostButFound user has the ability to create an account, log in, post/search for lost property by type, date, and location. A user has the ability to become a verified user by going through the proper admin channels. Once a user has found a match for property they are searching for they can submit a inquiry form with a short description of the property, location lost, and date lost. A user who gets an inquiry about property found, will recieve a notification with the form submitted by the searching user. Once the users are connected, it is ultimately up to the finding user to make a final decision whether or not to release the found property to the searching user.
